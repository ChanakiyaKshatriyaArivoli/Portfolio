# Sample workflow for building and deploying a React app to GitHub Pages

# To get started with Create React App: https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/
# Ensure your package.json includes "homepage": "https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>"
# and the "gh-pages" package is added as a devDependency.
